# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request

- List items should be sorted *alphabetically*.
- Each item should be limited to one link.
- The link should be the name of the package or project.
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.
- At least 3 items are needed to create a new category.

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with.
This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standards

- Generally useful to the wider community
- Actively maintained
  - Regular, recent commits
  - Or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to
- Stable or progressing toward stable
- Thoroughly documented (README, comments, docs, etc.) in english language, so everyone is able to understand the project's intention and how it works

## Maintainers

To make sure every PR is checked, we have [team maintainers](MAINTAINERS).
Every PR MUST be reviewed by at least two maintainers before it can get merged.

The maintainers will review your PR and notify you and tag it in case any information is still missing.
They will wait 30 days for your interaction, after that the PR will be closed.


## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource.
We realize sometimes packages fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know.
We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature.
These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days).
This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!
